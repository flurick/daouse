(if I did not forget to updated this header itself)


These are my personal notes on some of the projects Ive held interest in over the years,
years I did not track progress other than the rare anonomous patch or stabs of Q&A support
for various comunities with a heavy biased towards free and open source software (foss).
After a quickly resolved argument with relatives of how work should be documented and 
paied for, I now sligthly grumpy in mood to begin this process with I have to assume will
continue for the forseeable future.


To begin with I have used the following symbols to mean:

     #    Begining of a section about a project.
     :    Sub sections that may as well be read as thing that is on my todo list.
     ?    Sub section that raise question(s) Ive yet to found answered.
     //   A comment hopefully demonstrating how sections connect together and/or overlap.

#KDE

Personal project to look into:
:Missing
https://webchat.kde.org/#/welcome
:Incomplete 
kde4 -> kde5 port guide (mostly cmake, for example aurorae designer which I did little progress)

?
Qt Creator is recomended in many forums and wikis for KDE development, 
it is howerever several gigabytes. 
With niceties like an ui editor, code sugesstions, symbol navigation etc. 
while cool and all, do very likely hinder new developers.
Especailly if a qml treeview is 30$ nowadays

I know the three open painting apps set up a clear vision, 
which has drifted a bit over time.
But pwehaps the goals of the plasma desktop, 
and other KDE projects could be updated,
especially with the potential licensing wonders in mind.

As projects grow and grow, 
should we just go along with that force or start over at some point?
This also overlaps some with the first question of dev setup time, 
my concern being that while
leaglly permitted by license the software is free - 
but is it still free as in view, use, edit, share?
The term security through obscurity comes to mind.

#AzPainter

From what I have gathered this tool came from someone who had grown tired of other platforms  
and sat down, wrote a GUI library and made a perfectly poolished manga illustration software.
With so few dependencies it is quick to setup and build, comments are however in Japanese,
but still it is the smoothes implimentation of the gimp-shop smudge brushes Ive found.

#Serenity OS
#TinyCoreLinux
#TempelOS
#Smalltalk
#Oberon
#DynamicLand
