<h1>Blender for hand drawn animation?</h1>
<center>Last updated Sep 2021</center>

<section>
<h2>Why?</h2>
As 3D tools grow, they also become flexible enough to be suitable for 2D, and even hand drawn animation!

<h2>Common workflow expectations</h2>
So far in my experiments the GP add-on which maps the mouse wheel to pan the view and scroll the timeline works well. 
Tools switching is a bit clumsy with many button pressed and could use some tweaking.
<br><br>
Blenders "App Templates" allows you to redesign the whole UI and shortcuts, 
like the common functionality of saving different views for different tasks, 
but this adds on that to change the whole workflow if you want to.

<h2>2D shading with depth</h2>
What method is managable?
<br><br>
Using D shapes as multi colored 2D gradients, 
there has been some research papers written on this. 
The idea being, devices are already specialized in rendering 3D.
<br><br>
Using lights to shape gradients, 
an other more of a round about way of doing it is lighting an N-gon with spotlight of different colored light.

Q: Extruding GP strokes to give them volume?
I'm not sure where I was going with this thougt, using GP to 3D model ( which it alsmot kind of already does but it's not as smooth as one might hope)
