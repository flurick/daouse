<h1>Blender for hand drawn animation?</h1>
<center>Last updated Sep 2021</center>

<section>
<h2>Why?</h2>
The momentum of the 3D community and constantly evolving tools general enough momentum to be suitable for 2D,
and even hand drawn animation.

<h2>Common workflow expectations</h2>
So far in my experiemnts enabling the GP addon and having the mosue wheel pan/scroll the timeline has been enough.
Switching between tools is a bit clumsy and could use some tweaking (in my current keymap it's Shift + Ctrl + a number)
<br><br>
Blenders "App Templates" allows you to redesign the whole UI and shortcuts, like the common functionality of saving different views for different tasks, but this adds on that to change the whole wrokflow if you want to.

<h2>2D shading with depth</h2>
Whath method is managable?
<br><br>
Section on 3d shapes as gradients, there has been some reaserach papers made on using 3D shading methods to build non-linear gradients.
<br><br>
Using lights to shape gradients, an other more of a round about way of doing it is ligthing an N-gon with spotlight of different colored light.

Extruding GP strokes to give them volume?
Im not sure where I was going with this one.
