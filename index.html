	<p>An early experiemnt of drawing the existing characters frame by frame.</p>

	<p>A scene showing the homedelivery process I had the idea of going full on cartoon and just have the car jump over the screen in a great big swoosh. This did not fit the rest of our animations and was cut for consistency.</p>
