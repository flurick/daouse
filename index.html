	<p>Storykids - Introducing the Why and the How of the service.</p>

	<p>We wanted to align with the already establish playful visual style and drew inspiration from the colorful animal kingdom.</p>

	<p>An early experiment of drawing the existing characters frame by frame.</p>
	<img src="storykids/extra - cel.gif">

	<p>For the first animation tests of vector illustrations showed multiple ways we could go about animating the scenes.</p>

	<p>A scene showing the home delivery process I had the idea of going full on cartoon and just have the car jump over the screen in a great big swoosh. This did not fit the rest of our animations and was cut for consistency.</p>
