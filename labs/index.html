<h2>Experiments and work in progress and other things that are probably put on hold for the time being</h2>



<section>
	<h2>Why?</h2>
	As 3D tools grow, they also become flexible enough to be suitable for 2D, and even hand drawn animation!
	</section>
	
	<section>
	<h2>Common workflow expectations</h2>
	So far in my experiments the GP add-on which maps the mouse wheel to pan the view and scroll the timeline works well. 
	Tools switching is a bit clumsy with many button pressed and could use some tweaking.
	<br><br>
	Blenders "App Templates" allows you to redesign the whole UI and shortcuts, 
	like the common functionality of saving different views for different tasks, 
	but this adds on that to change the whole workflow if you want to.

	<h2>2D shading with depth</h2>
	What method is managable?
	<br><br>
	Using D shapes as multi colored 2D gradients, 
	there has been some research papers written on this. 
	The idea being, devices are already specialized in rendering 3D.
	<br><br>
	Using lights to shape gradients, 
	an other more of a round about way of doing it is lighting an N-gon with spotlight of different colored light.
	<br><br>
	Q: Extruding GP strokes to give them volume?
	I'm not sure where I was going with this thougt, using GP to 3D model ( which it alsmot kind of already does but it's not as smooth as one might hope)

	<h2>Page flipping MIDI edition</h2>
	Linux finding the controller id + setting up addrouts in the 3.0 alpha
	<a href="http://www.jpfep.net/pages/addroutes/">AddRoutes</a>
	(You probably need to update one file in the addons install directory)

	<h2>Related guides :)</h2>
	<br>
	ink textured strokes?
	<br><br>
	Alternative onionskinning addon 
	
	I cant seem to find this one again, I think it was the standrad sliders to change opacity per layer)

	<h2>Zero keyframe animation <br>(After Effects)</h2>
	<p>I wondered if you can make a walkcycle without using any keyframes? Only expressions</p>

	<p>Almost...</p>

	<h2>(<a href=https://alltd.org>Touchdesigner</a>)</h2>
	<p>We wondered if we could build a room of particles reacting to the movement of the poeple inside it.</p>

	<p>Yeah kinda...</p>

	<h2>Boosting the collective IQ - Getting our problem solving ability above the problems facing our world<br><a href=https://dougengelbart.org/>(Engelbart)</a></h2>
	<p>I wondered where all this momentun of using the computer as a tool came from?</p>
	<img src=image2.jpg>
	<p>With the one hand you could play chords on and the other hand pointed to change context. Why are these inventions coming back now again, many decades later?</p>
	<p>Unknown.</p>
